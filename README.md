# Minishell
This is an implementation of a simple terminal shell
To start it, simply execute the file, like:
> ./minishell

You case use your computer's built-in functions by explicitly
giving the path of the command, for example:
> /bin/ls -l 

This minishell has the pipe implementation too, for example:
> /bin/cat README.md | /usr/bin/grep shell
